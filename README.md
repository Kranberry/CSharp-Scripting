# CSharp-Scripting
This is a simple example of how you can run C# scripts on your .net application, either by filename or run everything inside a directory.

This program uses .net5 framework and the following libraries for the scripting implementation

Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.CSharp.Scripting;
Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.Scripting;

// This lets us add Task as a type. Could use var instead of importing this class

System.Threading.Tasks;
